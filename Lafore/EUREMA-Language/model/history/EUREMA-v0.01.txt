EUREMA v0.01

This version of the metamodel is described in the following technical report:

Thomas Vogel and Holger Giese. Model-Driven Engineering of Adaptation Engines 
for Self-Adaptive Software: Executable Runtime Megamodels. Technical Report 66, 
Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering, University of Potsdam, 
Germany, 4 2013. http://opus.kobv.de/ubp/volltexte/2013/6382/

while the following changes have been applied to the metamodel:

 - 'MegamodelPoxy' has been changed to 'MegamodelProxy' (typo removed)
 - A new attribute called 'payload' has been added to the 'Event' metaclass to
   reflect the content of an event occurring at runtime. The payload is determined
   at runtime when, for instance, the adaptable software emits an exception event
   and the payload reflects details of the exception. Thus, the payload is modeled
   by the engineer.
